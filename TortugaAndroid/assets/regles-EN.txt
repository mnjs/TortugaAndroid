- a jump starting a friend turtle or neutralized turtles is not obligatory.
- but jump over an opponent turtle is mandatory.
- when a jump has been started, it must be brought to an end by jumping as possible.
- in a same time, a turtle can jump over turtle friends and neutralized or she can jump over 
enemy and neutralized turtles. However a turtle should not jump in the same turn over 
friendly and enemy turtles.
